# Predictive Whittle Networks for Time Series

This repository is the official implementation of Predictive Whittle Networks (PWN) introduced in the paper titled [Predictive Whittle Networks for Time Series](https://ml-research.github.io/papers/yu2022whittle.pdf) by Zhongjie Yu, Fabrizio Ventola, Nils Thoma, Devendra Singh Dhami, Martin Mundt, and Kristian Kersting, published at UAI 2022.

It evolved from the implementation of the seminal work named "RECOWNs" [1], presented at the 4th Workshop on Tractable Probabilistic Modeling (TPM 2021) @ UAI 2021. 

The repository depends solely on PyTorch.
It also contains PyTorch implementations of other existing methods, e.g. Whittle SPNs [2], Conditional SPNs [3] or Spectral RNNs [4].

The employed dataset "Retail" and its related information have been removed from the repository due to a confidentiality agreement (NDA). 
Please, do not hesitate to open an issue or to write an e-mail to <nthoma@nilsthoma.de> if this causes issues in reproducing the results.

## Setup

This will clone the repo, install a Python virtual environment (requires Python 3.8), and the required packages.

    git clone https://github.com/ml-research/PWN.git
    cd PWN
    ./setup.sh

## Demos

### Activate the virtual environment:

    source ./venv_pwn/bin/activate

### To run an experiment on the data set Power

    python training.py

### To run a demo of a long range prediction

First, you need to download "data_cache_pwr_long.pkl" data from [TU datalib](https://tudatalib.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/handle/tudatalib/3532/):

    wget https://tudatalib.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/bitstream/handle/tudatalib/3532/data_cache_pwr_long.pkl -P res

and then launch the script:

    python long_term_prediction_showcase.py
